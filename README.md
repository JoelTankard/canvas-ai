# How to use
- Bring you own Open AI API key, only uses 4o-mini so won't cost anything really (Key is saved in session so REVOKE access after you're done)
- Upload documents (is buggy so might take a few attempts)
- press '/' to talk

- Agent will determine if based on your documents and message if there is an intent
- Zoom out to see the steps
- If feasible macros will be generated from the primatives
